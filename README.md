## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I discovered how easily a syntax error can lead to broken code. 
I had missed a closing tag in my index.html file, which caused any 
CSS changes to have no effect on the layout. Once I identified the error, 
I realized its impact. The lesson is: always ensure your foundation is solid before continuing.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about CSS styles, media query, and responsive layouts as I feel that these are important skills to learn in order to make a user friendly design.
